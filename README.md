# 🐍 Python Developer – Task 1 & Task 2  
Submitted by: Rekha Sheoran  
Platform: Google Colab  
Institute: Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  


📘 Project Overview  
This repository contains Python solutions for two major assignments:

- Task 1 – Foundational Python problems implemented in a `.py` script  
- Task 2 – Algorithmic challenges including sorting, recursion, and maze solving, implemented in a Jupyter Notebook

Each task includes interactive code, user input handling, and clean logic. All solutions follow the constraints provided, such as avoiding external libraries for visualization.



## 🧩 Task 1 – Problem List (in `python_task.py`)

1. Sum of Two Numbers  
2. Odd or Even Checker  
3. Factorial Calculation  
4. Fibonacci Sequence Generator  
5. Reverse a String  
6. Palindrome Check  
7. Leap Year Checker  
8. Armstrong Number Checker  
9. Custom Encryption-Decryption System  

📄 **File:** `python_task.py`


## 🧠 Task 2 – Problem List (in `python_task2.ipynb`)

1. Prime Number Checker  
2. Sum of Digits  
3. LCM and GCD Calculator  
4. List Reversal (without built-in functions)  
5. List Sorting (Bubble Sort)  
6. Remove Duplicates from List  
7. String Length (without `len()` function)  
8. Count Vowels and Consonants  
9. Maze Generator and Solver (DFS for generation, BFS for solving)

📄 **Notebook:** `python_task2.ipynb`

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. For Task 1: Run `python_task.py` in any Python environment (e.g., VS Code, terminal, or online IDE).
2. For Task 2: Open `python_task2.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in order and enter inputs when prompted.

## 📌 Notes

- No external libraries like `matplotlib` or `pygame` are used.
- Maze is visualized using text characters (`█`, ` `, `.`).
- All logic is implemented using standard Python and is beginner-friendly.

## 📂 Files Included

- `python_task.py` – Task 1 solutions (script format)  
- `python_task2.ipynb` – Task 2 solutions (notebook format)
